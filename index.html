    <pre> The word sepak is Malay (Jawi: سيڨق) for kick while the word takraw is of Thai (Thai: ตะกร้อ) origin, translated as muzzle or woven rattan ball.[6] "Sepak Takraw" quite literally means "to kick a rattan ball".[7] The choice of this name for the sport was essentially a compromise between Malaysia and Thailand in Kuala Lumpur in 1960.[8]






            
        In the past, it was called "Sepak Raga Jaring" in Malaysia,[1] after the term "Jaring", meaning net in Malay, was added to the traditional "Sepak Raga" game when it was created by Hamid Mydin in Penang in 1945. In Thailand, it is simply known by its original name of "Takraw".[1] Internationally, only the term "Sepak Takraw" is used to refer to the modern sport.[9]
